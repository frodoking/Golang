This directory contains:

 - .yaml files

    These contain test cases for endtoend_cli_test.go, in the directory above.
    They typically show a command to run, the directory to run it in (relative
    to test-filesystem), the files that the command should create, and a
    transcript of a debugging session that can follow from that command.
    endtoend_cli_test.go runs the commands, responds to prompts as specified
    in the transcript, and verifies that godebug behaves as it describes.

 - test-filesystem/

    This is the working directory where endtoend_cli_test.go runs its tests.
    The test sets GOPATH=test-filesystem/gopath:$GOPATH before running.


 - single-file-tests/

    See the README in that directory. It contains similar test files, used
    by endtoend_test.go.
